# Joaks

Things we need to do from previous deliveries feedback:  
- you should add a picture to the campaign, this way it would be easier to show in the lists you are using in rewards.
- edit profile: show what fields are mandatory and what are optional clearly
- make the look and feel of ALL pages consistent (ie edit-profile and create/add/delete-campaign) 


every time activate virtual environment. on mac:  
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment on macOS/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Activate the virtual environment in powershell  
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

if u install a new package, add it to requirements.txt by:  
pip freeze > requirements.txt
